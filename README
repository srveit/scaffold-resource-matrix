= ScaffoldResourceMatrix

The scaffold resource matrix generator creates a model, a controller,
and a set of templates that are ready to use as the starting point for
your REST-like, resource-oriented application. This basically means
that it follows a set of conventions to exploit the full set of HTTP
verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) and is prepared for multi-client access
(like one view for HTML, one for an XML API, one for ATOM,
etc). Everything comes with sample unit, functional and matrix tests
as well.

The resource may optionally be authenticated,
in which case all contorller actions require a user to be logged
in. Additional tests are added to the functional matrix test to test
for this.

The generator takes the name of the model as its first argument. This
model name is then pluralized to get the controller name. So
"scaffold_resource_matrix book" will generate a Book model and a
BooksController and will be intended for URLs like /books and
/books/45.
    
As additional parameters, the generator will take attribute pairs
described by name and type. These attributes will be used to
prepopulate the migration to create the table for the model and to
give you a set of templates for the view. For example,

  scaffold_resource_matrix book title:string created_on:date body:text published:boolean

will give you a model with those four attributes,
forms to create and edit those models from, and an index that'll list
them all.

You don't have to think up all attributes up front, but it's a good
idea of adding just the baseline of what's needed to start really
working with the resource.

Once the generator has run, you'll need to add a declaration to your
config/routes.rb file to hook up the rules that'll point URLs to this
new resource. If you create a resource like "scaffold_resource_matrix
book", you'll need to add "map.resources :books" (notice the plural
form) in the routes file. Then your new resource is accessible from
/books.

Note: This generator is an enhancement of the scaffold_resource
generator that comes with Rails.

== Examples

  ./script/generate scaffold_resource_matrix book # no attributes, view will be anemic
  ./script/generate scaffold_resource_matrix book title:string body:text published:boolean
  ./script/generate scaffold_resource_matrix book title:string body:text published:boolean --authenticated
